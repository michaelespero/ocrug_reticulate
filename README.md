# Using R and Python Together with Reticulate

R and Rstudio are great for workflows in statistics and data science, but what if you need to use a library that's only available in Python? What if your collaborators work in Python and you work primarily in R? How might you share code and make it so your workflows come together seamlessly? The `Reticulate` package helps with these issues and can make bringing together R and Python a joy. 

Surely the folks at [RStudio](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/index.html) are the best source of information about this recent thrust in interoperability, however, after getting a feel for `reticulate` and how it might fit into my own workflow I'm happy to share a point of view about how to add this powerful tool to your own data science toolbox.
